        "What is Clustering?\n",
        "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points together. The goal of clustering is to find hidden patterns or structures in the data without requiring predefined labels. It is widely used in various applications such as customer segmentation, image compression, anomaly detection, and document classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "K-means\n",
        "K-means is one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning and clustering algorithms and is well known for its simplicity. This algorithm aims to separate unlabeled data into different clusters(subgroups) with the number of clusters represented by the variable K. Data points in the same cluster are very similar, while data points in different clusters are very different. The similarity of data is based on some similarity metric, where the similarity metric can be distance-based, correlation-based, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple and fast for large datasets\n",
        "Works well with well-separated clusters\n",
        "Challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "Requires specifying K in advance\n",
        "Sensitive to initial centroid selection\n",
        "Assumes spherical clusters (does not work well for non-convex shapes)\n",
        "In our case, we will use distance-based metrics. Any distance-based metrics for numeric variables can be employed, for example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Euclidean distance\n",
        "Manhattan distance\n",
        "Cosine similarity\n",
        "There is an example how K-means works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you have a bunch of dots scattered on a piece of paper. These dots represent data points, and the goal of the k-means algorithm is to group similar dots into clusters\n",
        "\n",
        "To start, you randomly select k dots from the scatter plot and assign each one to be the centre of a cluster. These k dots are called centroids.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, you calculate the distance between each dot and each centroid and assign each dot to the closest centroid, effectively grouping the dots into k clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, you recalculate the centroid of each cluster by finding the average position of all the dots in that cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the centroids no longer change, meaning the clusters have stabilized.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the algorithm outputs the k clusters and the corresponding centroids.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our case, we would use a Euclidian distance as a metric. Mathematically speaking, the goal would be to minimalize the following objective function:\n",

        "\n",
        "Customer Segmentation: k-means can segment customers based on their demographic information or purchase behavior. This information can then be used for targeted marketing or to improve the customer experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Image Compression: k-means can reduce the number of colors in an image while preserving its visual quality. This is done by replacing similar color pixels with a single color, thereby reducing the amount of data required to represent the image.\n",
